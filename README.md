# Amplitude Java SDK
The backend Java SDK for server-side instrumentation.

## Amplitude and Ampli SDK
[Ampli SDK](https://developers.data.amplitude.com/ampli-sdk-overview/) is autogenerated library based on your pre-defined [tracking plan](https://developers.data.amplitude.com/what-is-a-tracking-plan). The Ampli SDK, is a lightweight wrapper over the Amplitude SDK that provides type-safety, supports linting, and enables features like input validation. The code replicates the spec in the Tracking Plan and enforces its rules and requirements. This repository is about **Amplitude SDK**. To learn more about Ampli SDK, please refer to the [Ampli JRE](https://developers.data.amplitude.com/jre-ampli) and [examples](https://github.com/amplitude/ampli-examples).
